# PySortGUI

PySortGUI is a simple GUI for visualization of some well-known sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms

- Heapsort;
- Mergesort;

- Bubble sort.

## Features

- Adjustable array size (up to the width of the screen resolution);
- 'Nearly sorted' intial array (also known as K-sorted) with adjustable K;
